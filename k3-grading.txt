Guideline for Kernel Assignment 3
=================================

Total points: 100

+---------------------+
| General Guidelines: |
+---------------------+

1)  The points below are maximum points.  Partial credits may be given, if
    appropriate.

2)  Grade what's in the "plus points" section first, then grade the "minus
    points" to deduct points.

3)  Please read the student's README first to see if you need to do something
    different to get their code to work and what the known problems are.  The
    grader must not modify ANY source code and the grader can only grade on a
    32-bit standard Ubuntu 16.04 system.

4)  The scripts below are for csh/tcsh.  If you use bash, please modify them
    where necessary.  Or, you can do "tcsh" and then run the scripts.

5)  The grading is meant to be harsh!  In the "plus points" section, if running
    the "diff" command is suppose to produce no output, but the student's code
    produces some output, most likely, no corresponding plus points will be earned.
    Again, we cannot grade base of "effort".  Similarly, if running the "diff"
    command suppose to produce some output, but the student's code produces no
    output or in the wrong format, most likely, no corresponding plus points will
    be earned.

6)  Unless otherwise specified, the minimum deduction for a mistake of any kind
    is 0.5 pt (unless you have lost all the points allocated for a particular
    test/subtest) even if all are caused by the same programming bug.  If a range
    is specified (e.g., -5 to -10 pts), it means that if such an error occured,
    even just once, the minimum will be deducted.  From that point on, each
    additional occurrence will incur a 0.5 pt deduction.

7)  The posted grading guidelines is not perfect.  We will try our best to stick
    to the grading guidelines.  Sometimes, after we started grading some of the
    submissions, we realize that we missed something (most often in "minus
    points").  The bottomline is that we reserve the right to add or change
    things in the grading guidelines as we see fit (or take additiona deductions
    if you don't follow the spec).  By default, if the spec says that you are
    required to implement something, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in
    the grading guidelines, you must follow the spec.  Please don't assume that
    it's fine not to follow the spec.  If you are not sure about something, it's
    best to send an e-mail to the instructor for clarification.

8)  The grader will grade using a different set of "data" (we will try our best
    not to change the script).  Any numerical value or filename in a commandline
    arguments is also considered "data".  The contents of all test data files
    will also be changed.  Some filenames can also change.  So, you need to make
    sure that your code can handle any input (good and bad).

Make sure GDBWAIT=0, DRIVERS=1, VFS=1, S5FS=1, VM=1, and DYNAMIC=0 in Config.mk.
Must start weenix using "./weenix -n".  If you are running user space shell, the
only way to exit weenix is to run "/sbin/halt" from the user space shell prompt.

(A) KASSERT : +40 points
        Invoke /sbin/init from initproc_run(), type /sbin/halt at prompt.
        Use DBG=error,print,test in Config.mk for grading.

        Students need to have the following KASSERT statements in their code and
            at the right places and they need to function correctly (i.e., must
            place "conforming dbg() calls" immediately after the KASSERT statements
            to demonstrate that these KASSERT statements are successfully executed
            in order to get any credit).

        Please note that if one runs /sbin/init from initproc_run() and type
            /sbin/halt at user-space shell prompt, all the functions below should
            be invoked and all the KASSERT statements should be reached.  If
            /sbin/init cannot work and kshell is used instead to run individual
            subtests and if a particular KASSERT statement cannot be reached
            simply by starting and stopping weenix, students must use TWO
            consecutive "conforming dbg() calls" immediately after the
            corresponding KASSERT statements in these functions where the first
            one refers to (A) and the 2nd one refers to a subtest in section (B)
            or (D).

        For a "conforming dbg() call" immediately after a requred KASSERT, you
            must use the correct format, i.e., dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3A X.Y)\n")
            where X is a number between 1 and 8, and Y is a corresponding subtest
            letter.  If an incorrect format is used (but have the same information
            content), the most you can get for each such item is 50% of the
            allocated points.  If such a "conforming dbg() call" is missing, you
            will not get any credit.

        Not suppose to crash or freeze weenix; otherwise, deduct 0.5 pt in
            the appropriate minus point item each time crash or freeze happens
        In case you cannot get user-space shell to work, you can call
            kernel_execve() from a kshell to run these tests.
        Please run each command twice in a row.  If each of

(E) Extra credit (must run from user-space shell) : +5 points
        Use DBG=error,test in Config.mk for grading all tests below.

        Please note that the grader will not run these tests by default.
        To indicate to the grader that this part needs to be graded, simply give
            yourself a non-zero grade in your vm-README.txt file.  The grader will grade
            a subtest with DYNAMIC=1 in "Config.mk" for any subtest with a non-zero grade.
        Update "Config.mk" to have DYNAMIC=1, recompile and restart weenix.
    (1) (1 pt) /usr/bin/vfstest
                    no partial credit (basically either all or nothing)
                    should pass all 671 tests with 0 failure, do this twice without restarting
                    must proceed to next test without restarting
    (2) (1 pt) /usr/bin/memtest
                    no partial credit (basically either all or nothing)
                    should pass all 331 tests with 0 failure, do this twice without restarting
                    must proceed to next test without restarting
    (3) (1 pt) /usr/bin/eatmem
                    no partial credit (basically either all or nothing)
                    should eat around 10000 pages then all "given back", do this twice without restarting
                    must proceed to next test without restarting
    (4) (1 pt) /usr/bin/forkbomb limit250
                    no partial credit (basically either all or nothing)
                    this test puts itself in the background to fork 250 times
                    run the following programs one after another (no need to verify printout):
                        vfstest
                        memtest
                        eatmem
                        /sbin/halt
                    gets full credit if weenix is halted cleanly (otherwise, no credit)
    (5) (1 pt) /usr/bin/stress limit250
                    no partial credit (basically either all or nothing)
                    right before getting the prompt back, the last two messages must be "(note that this is running in the background)"
                            and "Will fork 250 times..." (no credit if this is not the case)
                    this test puts itself in the background to continue to fork 250 times
                    run the following programs one after another:
                        vfstest
                        memtest
                        eatmem
                        /sbin/halt
                    gets full credit if weenix is halted cleanly (otherwise, no credit)

(F) SELF-checks : +10 points
        Use DBG=error,print,test in Config.mk for grading.

        Every code sequence you wrote to replace a NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED() call
        must be reachable by starting and stopping the kernel or using a test
        case.  It can either be tested when you run any of the above tests or 
        you can use additional tests to demonstrate it (and document it in 
        section (F) of the submitted README file regarding what test to run).  
        In either case, you must use a correctly labeled dbg() call to 
        demonstrate that every code sequence can be exercised.

        For every unreachable code sequence or a code sequence that does not have
        a "conforming dbg() call" at the END of the code sequence, take 1 point
        off. Take 0.5 point off if it is not clear what test to run to get to
        that code sequence.  Please note that such "conforming dbg() call" is
        required at the END of every code sequence as specified in the spec.
        You will not get credit for putting such information in a code comment
        or not at the END of a code sequence (although if you put it close
        enough to the END of the code sequence, we will deduct 0.5 pt).

        You must use a correctly formatted "conforming dbg() calls".  Take 1 point off
        for each incorrectly formatted or mis-labeled "conforming dbg() calls".
        You must use a correctly formatted "conforming dbg() calls".  These are the
        choices:
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3A)\n") to mean simply starting and stopping the kernel, if applicable
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3B X)\n") where X is a number between 1 and 7, if applicable
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3C X)\n") where X is a number between 1 and 5, if applicable
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3D X)\n") where X is a number between 1 and 5, if applicable
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3E X)\n") where X is a number between 1 and 5, if applicable
                use dbg(DBG_PRINT, "(GRADING3F X)\n") where X is an extra test you have written for the purpose of SELF-checks, if applicable
            NOTE: "if applicable" means that if you have a separate command to run part of the subtests, you need to include subtest or subtest.item information
            NOTE: must not use dbg_print()
            NOTE: must use notation to include a subtest number if a separate command must be used to run a subtest
            NOTE: -1 pt for each instance of including extra information in a conforming dbg() call
            NOTE: -0.5 pt for not using "\n" in a conforming dbg() call

If a range is specified, it means that even if it only happens once, the grader must apply the minimum deduction.

Missing/incomplete required section(s) in README file (vm-README.txt): -3 points (even if lots of comments in code)
                      deduct 0.5 point each for every missing/incomplete item in README

Submission in wrong file format : -2 points

Submitted binary file : -2 points

Submitted extra file : -2 points

Wrong file location in submission : -2 points if files are not in correct directory
                      if the submission does not preserve the directory structure,
                          take 2 points off

Altered or removed top comment block in a .c file : -20 points for each such file

Altered or removed SIGNATURE : -20 points

Extra printout when running with DBG=error,test or DBG=error,print,test in Config.mk: -5 points
                      if you have debugging printout for yourself, you must use DBG_TEMP so it can be turned off in Config.mk

Cannot compile      : -5 to -10, depending on effort to make it work
                      if cannot generate executable, at least 5 points
                          will be taken off, up to 10 points off if it
                          takes a lot to make it work
                      this assumes that there is a way to compile your
                          program, if not, you probably wouldn't have
                          earned any "plus points" anyway

Compiler warnings   : -1 to -3 points
                      take 1 point off for 1-4 warnings, 2 points off
                          for 5-8 warnings, 3 points for more
                      if you disabled compiler warnings, we will take
                          20 points off

"make clean"        : -2 points if cannot delete all binary files created during compilation
                      (.o files, .gch files, executable files, etc.)

Race condition in sched_switch() : -5 points if race condition is not fixed in
                          sched_switch() and pressing a key would unfreeze
                      deduct 1 point each time this happens

Kernel panic when running tests : -5 to -10 points
                      if kernel panic just once, deduct 5 points,
                          for each additional occurrance, deduct 1 pt

Kernel freezes when running tests : -5 to -10 points
                      if kernel freezes just once, deduct 5 points,
                          for each additional occurrance, deduct 1 pt

Cannot halt kernel cleanly when shutting down (not due to panic or freeze) : -5 to -10 points
                      if failed to see the "weenix: halted cleanly" message
                          just once, deduct 5 points, for each additional
                          occurrance, deduct 1 pt
